# Dwarf Sword Goblin
Barely a game!<br><br>
This is the [Unity's 2018 Fundamentals Course](https://learn.unity.com/project/unity-2018-fundamentals) put to practice.

It's just a sample project with 2 Scenes, one being the menu. 
<br>I've never worked with Unity3D before, so this was a neat way to get started with it. :D <br>
Commits starts by Lesson 3 (I wasn't using github with Unity before...).

## Regarding the Assets
<br>All assets belong to the course in question. So, their <b>licenses remains the same</b>.

## Misc
<br>Coding by me (following the course). 
<br> Scene setup is a little different from the course. 
<br> I think that's all. If you need anything, contact me at [adrianogsss@gmail.com](mailto:adrianogsss@gmail.com)
